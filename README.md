# Learning Redux without React.

I used this repository in the **Udacity - React Nanodegree** course to learn the concepts of **Flux** and the implementation of **Redux**.

I've manually created a simple UI and all code implementation responsible for managing the **Redux Store** part. After that the manual implementation was replaced by the Redux library (without using React), to show that all concepts learned apply in practice.
